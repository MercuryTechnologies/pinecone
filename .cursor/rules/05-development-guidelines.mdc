# Pinecone Development Guidelines

## Code Style

This project follows standard Haskell code conventions (with the exception of record fields):
- Use 4-space indentation
- Use camelCase for function and variable names
- Use PascalCase for types and constructors
- Use snake_case for record fields to match Pinecone API naming

## Language Extensions

The project enables several language extensions by default in the cabal file:
- BlockArguments
- DataKinds
- DeriveGeneric
- DeriveAnyClass
- DerivingStrategies
- DuplicateRecordFields
- GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving
- NamedFieldPuns
- OverloadedLists
- OverloadedStrings
- RecordWildCards
- TypeApplications
- TypeOperators

## Record Fields

Some record fields begin with underscore (`_`) to match the Pinecone API field names (e.g. `_id` and `_score`, which have underscores in the Pinecone API).  Other record field names end with an underscore to conflicting with Haskell keywords (e.g. `data_` instead of `data`).

## Dependencies

Main external dependencies include:
- servant/servant-client - For API type definitions and client generation
- aeson - For JSON serialization/deserialization
- http-client/http-client-tls - For HTTP communication
- text - For text handling
- vector - For vector data structures

## Testing

The test suite is located in the `tasty/` directory and uses the HUnit and Tasty testing frameworks.
