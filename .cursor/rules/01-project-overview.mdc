# Pinecone Haskell Library

This is a Haskell binding to the Pinecone vector database API using `servant` for type-safe HTTP client generation.

## Key Files

- [src/Pinecone.hs](mdc:src/Pinecone.hs) - Main entry point that re-exports functionality from other modules
- [pinecone-example/Main.hs](mdc:pinecone-example/Main.hs) - Example implementation showing basic usage

## Project Structure

The codebase follows a modular structure:

- `src/Pinecone.hs` - Main module that exports all functionality
- `src/Pinecone/` directory - Contains specialized modules for different Pinecone API features
- `pinecone-example/` - Example usage of the library
- `tasty/` - Test suite

## Key Concepts

- `ControlMethods` - Methods for managing Pinecone indexes (create, delete, etc.)
- `DataMethods` - Methods for working with vector data (upsert, search, etc.)
- The API is split into control plane (index management) and data plane (vector operations)
